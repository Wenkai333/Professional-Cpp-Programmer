# Professional C++ Programmer

**My structured journey to move beyond basic C++ usage and master professional development practices.**

## üéØ Learning Goals

Becoming a professional C++ developer who can:
- Write efficient, maintainable, and safe C++ code
- Master memory management and resource handling  
- Use modern C++ features effectively
- Design scalable software architectures
- Debug and optimize performance-critical applications

Extra:
- Integrated **Claude AI** as a learning accelerator and development productivity tool

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`Source/`** - Reference material for building the study
- **`Project/`** - Hands-on projects and implementations
- **`Notes/`** - Learning notes, summaries, and insights
