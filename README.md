# Professional C++ Programmer

**My structured journey to move beyond basic C++ usage and master professional development practices.**

## 🎯 Learning Goals

Becoming a professional C++ developer who can:

- Write efficient, maintainable, and safe C++ code
- Master memory management and resource handling
- Use modern C++ features effectively
- Design scalable software architectures
- Debug and optimize performance-critical applications

Extra:

- Integrated **Claude AI** as a learning accelerator and development productivity tool

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`Source/`** - Reference material for building the study
- **`Project/`** - Hands-on projects and implementations
- **`Notes/`** - Learning notes, summaries, and insights

## 📈 Current Progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Study Projects Example

```bash
# Navigate to projects directory
cd Project/

# Create new study project (uses our custom template)
new-cpp-ng NewProject

# Work on studies...
cd NewProject
./scripts/build.sh
code .

# Save progress
cd ~/workspace/Professional-Cpp-Programmer/
git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: Task"
git push origin main
```
