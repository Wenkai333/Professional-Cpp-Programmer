## Self-Assessment Questions

### Core Competency Check
Can you confidently explain and implement:

1. **RAII**: "Why is this the most important C++ idiom?"
2. **Move Semantics**: "When does move construction happen automatically?"
3. **Smart Pointers**: "When would you use weak_ptr over shared_ptr?"
4. **Templates**: "How does SFINAE work and when do you need it?"
5. **Exception Safety**: "What's the difference between basic and strong exception safety?"

### Advanced Knowledge Check
1. **Memory**: "How do custom allocators improve performance?"
2. **Concurrency**: "What's the difference between memory_order_relaxed and memory_order_acquire?"
3. **Performance**: "How do you identify and fix cache misses?"
4. **Templates**: "When would you use CRTP instead of virtual functions?"

### Professional Readiness Check
1. **Debugging**: "How do you debug a memory corruption in production?"
2. **Architecture**: "How do you design a C++ API that's both fast and maintainable?"
3. **Trade-offs**: "When would you choose composition over inheritance?"
4. **Standards**: "What C++20 features would you use in a new project and why?"

## Learning Priority for Working Programmers

### If you're already using C++ professionally, focus on:

**Immediate Impact (1-2 months)**:
1. Move semantics mastery
2. Smart pointer best practices  
3. Modern STL algorithms
4. Exception safety patterns

**Career Growth (3-6 months)**:
1. Template system depth
2. Concurrency fundamentals
3. Performance optimization
4. Code review skills

**Senior Level (6-12 months)**:
1. Advanced template techniques
2. Architecture patterns
3. Mentoring and knowledge sharing
4. Domain expertise in your field

## Red Flags: What NOT to Focus On (Initially)

### Common Time Wasters:
- **Complex template metaprogramming** before mastering basics
- **Assembly optimization** before understanding high-level performance
- **Cutting-edge features** before mastering fundamentals
- **Framework-specific knowledge** without understanding underlying principles

### Academic vs Professional:
- **Academic**: Implementing complex data structures from scratch
- **Professional**: Knowing when to use std::vector vs std::deque vs std::list

- **Academic**: Perfect template metaprogramming
- **Professional**: Writing maintainable, testable code

The goal is to become someone who can:
- **Write correct, efficient, maintainable C++ code**
- **Review code and catch common mistakes**
- **Architect systems that perform well and evolve gracefully**  
- **Mentor other developers and explain complex concepts clearly**
- **Make informed technical decisions based on trade-offs**

Which of these areas do you feel strongest/weakest in? That will help prioritize your learning path.
